# A gamified campaign for Toyota Belgium

To promote the launch of the new Rav 4 for Toyota, Abstraktion developed an app that converted adventures into rewards.

How do you rate "adventurousness"? When we thought about it, we came up with a logorithmic approach combining a number of metrics; proximity to landmarks like forests and lakes, distance from cities, altitude above sea level and a few other factors we're keeping under wraps.

We used this logic to power a fun reward-based campaign for the launch of Toyota's new Rav 4. Adventure Discount, a beautiful app built with PhoneGap, allowed for check&#8209;in at any location to retrieve a discount on a Rav 4.

The discount management was handled by a slim API, which additionally powered a responsive website for use in dealerships to verify discount codes and to track performance from a national view down to street level.
