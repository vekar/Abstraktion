# Mapping pollution to promote a Hybrid car

One of Abstraktion's first native mobile apps, we used data from hundreds of particulate matter sensors across Brussels to create a pollution heatmap.

What better way to showcase the benefits of a Hybrid vehicle than by showing the existing levels of pollution they help to reduce?

To promote the launch of the new Auris Hybrid, we developed Toyota Air Quality. We built a slim API to handle processing and exposure of pollution data from hundreds of sensors across Brussels. On top of this, we built an elegant PhoneGap application to visualise the results.

Updated hourly, the app allowed users to plan routes in real-time, avoiding pollution. It was a great example of a brand engaging a consumer by creating a relevant and benefitical utility.
