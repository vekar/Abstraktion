David Lloyd Playlist provides scientifically curated playlists to match your style of workout. Tracks are identified based on a series of BPM ranges and key mappings. The result, more effective and sustainable workouts for all.

We started with design, wireframing an intuitive flow for a complex pricing model. We kept the UI flat and minimal, working from the artwork up to ensure a definitively "music" experience.

The base of the product is a simple Rails application, which collects audio files directly from Universal's Supply chain and funells selected music into playlists. Along the way, it performs some serious transcoding to ensure audio is always optimised for mobile listeners. The app serves an API, which allows for selective access to content and stats.

After that, we produced the iOS and Android app. With timelines tight, we opted to use [Trigger](http://trigger.io) to allow us to build the app with the tools we knew best, Javascript and HTML 5, and deploy to both targets in a single hit.
