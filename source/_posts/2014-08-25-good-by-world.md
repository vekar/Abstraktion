To serve as some form of legacy for what Abstraktion did and achieved, I will be using the Abstraktion moniker as my own portfolio and journal going forward, showcasing and documenting our journey into startup life.

You can read some of our original thoughts and the process of our transition in my Medium article, [Change is the end result of all true learning](/).
