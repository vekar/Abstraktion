The WSA came to Abstraktion with the goal of building a ground up tournament manager to streamline their operations and grow their audience.

Creating a simple and stripped back visual language around the goals and brand, and adopting a mobile first approach, we made full use of modern development tools to radpily prototype a bedrock for ongoing digital activity.

The end result is a high scale Rails application, providing point by point match reports, automated ranking generation and powerful visualisations around the wealth of statistics like player rank history and tournament trees.
