# Making Table Tennis Discoverable

In 2011, Abstraktion worked with The English Table Tennnis Association to make Table Tennis more searchable. Spotlight was the result.

One of the first large scale responsive websites to be launched in the UK, Spotlight provided immediate access to more than 7,000 Table Tennis clubs and venues.

Using HTML 5's geolocation features, mobile users could find their nearest table, get directions and start playing. The venues included clubs, bars and even outdoor tables as part of Ping England.

We built crowd-sourcing of new venues into Spotlight to allow for organic growth, and added peer review and favouriting to measure the most popular venues.

Strategically, Spotlight proved vital for the growth of the sport and allowed ETTA to discover and measure venues across the country.
