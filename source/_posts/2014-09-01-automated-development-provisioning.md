# Automating our development provisioning for fun and profit

One of the most frustrating phenomenons I've experienced overtime is the on-boarding of new developers with a team.

The constant battle, spilling over days, of getting all the right dependencies in place for every project. It's a headache. With Beatroot, I wanted to take this hassle away, and after a little research and repurposing of our production configuration process, managed to get on-boarding down to a single command...

I covered the whole process, and what was required, in my Medium article [A Polished Gem without the Friction](https://medium.com/@chrsgrrtt/a-polished-gem-without-the-friction-8e3252885fdd).
