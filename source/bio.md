# "Hunter of the Great North"

I'm a 24 year old Bristolian, currently hailing from the small North West town of Macclesfield. I'm a father of two boisterous and brilliant daughters, long-term fiancee and compulsive nail-biter. I like well aged Rum, fruity black coffee and crisp Autumn mornings.

### Professional

Professionally, I'm the Product Director and Co-Founder of [Beatroot](http://beatroot.com), a music discovery service with the lofty goal of making the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end.

To be specific, I lead the identification and continuous delivery of Beatroot products and services. For me, this is a heady mix of technical strategy, interface design and team management. There are many different definitions of Product Director, but this one is mine. On a typical day you'll find me embroiled in test-driven Ruby development, polishing interfaces in Sketch and spending far too much time playing Table Tennis.

Before Beatroot, I founded and for 3 years lead Abstraktion, the moniker I now assume as my own. Abstraktion was originally setup to support advertising agencies with technical production and delivery, but quickly grew into one of the UK's leading digital product companies, with an impressive client list to boot. With a small team, comprising the most talented and passionate people I'll ever meet, we designed and built the mobile applications and experiences we felt mattered.

Since starting my first fledgling company 8 years ago, I've spent more time than I'd care to admit in and around agency culture. As a result, however, I've been fortunate enough to work with brands like Universal Music, Spotify, Google, BBC, Channel 4, Toyota, Disney and Shire Pharmaceuticals. I'm excited to now be focusing all my energies on changing the music industry with Beatroot.

### Digital Edge

I set up Digital Edge after moving to Macclesfield in 2011, to host meetups and presentation nights showcasing and connecting the local Digital and Creative companies. Since then the group has grown to a number in excess of 200 and I'm continually impressed with the diversity and resillience of our members.

This year we're looking to take Digital Edge a step further, adding more events to our calendar, taking on sponsorship and providing a co-working and communal event space for the community.

If you're North West based, I've love to see you at an upcoming event.

### Speaking

While I'm by no means an accomplished presenter, I have been known to present at conferences and meetups. I've only recently come to appreciate the value of speaking publicly and am looking to do more of it. The same is true of writing.

If you're looking for someone to speak at your event about product strategy and direction, or perhaps talk about the journey from agency to startup, please feel free to [drop me an email](mailto:hello@abstraktion.co.uk).
