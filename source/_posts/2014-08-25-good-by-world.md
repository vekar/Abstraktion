# Good-bye World&hellip;

Abstraktion was a UK based digital product development company. We worked hard, had fun and delivered game-changing applications for brands like Universal Music, Domino Records, Spotify, The BBC, Channel 4, Toyota and Google.

## In 2014 we closed our doors to start a new journey, [Beatroot](http://beatroot.com). This is our retrospective&hellip;

To serve as some form of legacy for what Abstraktion did and achieved, I will be using the Abstraktion moniker as my own portfolio and journal going forward, showcasing and documenting our journey into startup life.

You can read some of our original thoughts and the process of our transition in my Medium article, [Change is the end result of all true learning](https://medium.com/@chrsgrrtt/change-is-the-end-result-of-all-true-learning-d73d9dd724d6).
