# Guilty Pledgers, Spotify for good&nbsp;causes

Guilty Pledgers came to Abstraktion to make their goal of using Spotify for philanthropy a reality.

Guilty Pledgers is a simple concept:

1. Create a fundraising party through the Spotify app or on the website.
2. Choose your favourite charity, set a date and invite some friends.
3. Send them to guiltypledgers.com to add songs to the playlist, pledging to the charity each time.
4. After having a great evening at your party, the guests receive an email to pay their pledges via JustGiving.

Technically, we created a single HTML 5 application that could be deployed as both a packaged Spotify application or alternatively as a website.

The application works across platforms, and makes use of web sockets, allowing attendees to pledge from their phones at the party, with the playlist updating in real-time. Additionally, Facebook login makes it super simple to join the party, and for hosts to share their parties with friends.

## Available at [GuiltyPledgers.com](http://guiltypledgers.com) and on the [Spotify App Finder](spotify:app:guilty-pledgers).
