# Geek hiring, or how we built our own Cerebro

Finding and hiring talent was one of the biggest challenges Abstraktion faced over it's 3 year life span. This established a belief, in my mind, that the majority of the North West's developer's favoured PHP. We started to think of South Manchester based Ruby developers as Unicorns.

One of the first R&amp;D projects we under took at Beatroot was a simple scrape and geo-index of local developer profiles from Github. We thought we would use the results to guide our stack choice for our core services. Not only did the results help us dispell untruths about the North West dev scene, they also helped us establish a "talent pipeline".
