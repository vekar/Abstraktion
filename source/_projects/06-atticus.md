# The Atticus Installation at Southbank Centre

Working with [Nonatomic](http://www.nonatomic.co.uk/), Abstraktion created the Atticus, an experiential installation for London's Southbank Centre.

The installation allowed visitors to put themselves into someone elses skin and answer the question "What does it feel like to look in the mirror and see someone else looking back at you?".

Prototyped in HTML 5, and then built for production in Unity, the installation featured photo-realistic 3D models of three Southbank locals: a member of staff; a midwife from Guys and St. Thomas' and a young person from community group SE1 United. These were created using advanced scanning and motion capture techniquesand then animated based on real-time input from a Microsoft Kinect, allowing visitors to momentarily assume someone else's identity.

## The installation ran at Southbank Centre during August and September of 2013
