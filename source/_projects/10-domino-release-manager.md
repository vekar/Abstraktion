# Domino Records Release Manager

Domino came to Abstraktion with the noble goal of creating "Basecamp for an International Record Label".

We spent a long time working on the data model for the application. It needed to encapsulate complexities like territorial label and publishing rights, which we were able to achieve simply and elegantly through skilled database design.

Built in Rails, the application provides Domino with a full-set of features, including catalogue management and milestone tracking. All wrapped in a beautiful and intuitive interface. It's fully responsive, allowing for use across the business, in any environment.

After initial delivery, we ran a number of pair programming sessions with Domino's in-house developers to allow for a smooth handover and ongoing maintenance of the product.

## For internal use at Domino Records only.
