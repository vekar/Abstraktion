# Mapping Britain's illness through Prescription Data

Avicenna was our entry into the North West health hack, a product designed to help identify where to run clinical trials.

Over a weekend, we identified, parsed and analysed more than 6 billion rows of prescription data.

We started by identifying which conditions different medications were used to treat, and creating a mapping. We then took prescription quantities for all drugs on a per practice basis, from 100s of CSV files. Finally, we geocoded each of the prescribing surgeries and indexed them with Solr.

The result? A heatmap of conditions, searchable by location, right down to street level.
