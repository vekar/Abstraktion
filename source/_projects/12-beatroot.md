Beatroot is a powerful music discovery platforms. We work directly with labels to ingest and process their catalogue, obtaining data range from tempo to key to sentiment. We then provide powerful filtering and curation via our API.

In addition to this, we are actively developing a ground-breaking new product for publishers and sync departments.
